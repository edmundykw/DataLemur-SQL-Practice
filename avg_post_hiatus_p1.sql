Question: 

Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021,
write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. 
Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

p.s. If you've read the Ace the Data Science Interview and liked it, consider writing us a review?

/*My solution:*/
SELECT user_id, EXTRACT(DAY FROM MAX(post_date) - MIN(post_date)) AS days_between
  FROM posts
  WHERE post_date >= '2021-01-01'
  AND post_date <= '2021-12-31'
  GROUP BY
    user_id
  HAVING COUNT(post_id) > 1;
